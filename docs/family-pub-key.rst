******************************
Public Key Transaction Family
******************************

Overview
========

The *Public Key* transaction family provides a trustless way to store the public key based on RSA cryptosystem on the REMchain.

Definitions of Public Key Entries
---------------------------------

The following protocol buffers definition define public key entries:

.. code-block:: protobuf

    message PubKeyStorage {
         // Public key of a user who added the certificate
         string owner = 1;
         // X.509 certificate entity
         NewPubKeyPayload payload = 2;
         // status of the certificate
         bool revoked = 3;
    }

Addressing
----------

Address for storing the *PubKeyStorage* is constructed using *make_address_from_data* of the *BasicHandler* with a **public key** provided.

Transaction Payload
===================

Public Key transaction family payloads are defined by the following protocol
buffers code:

.. code-block:: protobuf

    message NewPubKeyPayload {
        enum EntityType {
            PERSONAL = 0;
            SERVER = 1;
        }

        enum PubKeyType {
            RSA = 0;
        }
        // PEM Encoded public key
        string public_key = 1;
        PubKeyType public_key_type = 2;
        // For future ACME support(Now only Personal)
        EntityType entity_type = 3;
        // hash of PEM encoded public key of certificate
        string entity_hash = 4;
        string entity_hash_signature = 5;
        // UNIX time when validity begins
        uint32 valid_from = 6;
        // UNIX time when validity ends
        uint32 valid_to = 7;
    }

    message RevokePubKeyPayload {
        // The address of a certificate in the storage generated by the transaction processor.
        string address = 1;
    }


Transaction Header
==================

Inputs and Outputs
------------------

The inputs and outputs for Pub Key family transactions in respect to payload must include:

* **NewPubKeyPayload**: Sender's account address, *public_key address*
* **RevokePubKeyPayload**: *public_key address*

Dependencies
------------

None.

Family
------

- family_name: "pub_key"
- family_version: "0.1"

Encoding
--------

The encoding field must be set to "application/protobuf".


To-Do
=========

Add support for:

* PKCS1v15
* PSS
